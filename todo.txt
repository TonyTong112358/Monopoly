    make sure I can get some fucking Sprites

functionality:
    sliding window has a problem it doesn't work 


board:
    worry about coordinate points an dhow to move pieces 





netowrking:
    listen, accept, use pickle
    oimplement usernames
    ip address( to send money)



problems :
    how am I getting 100 fucking cards imported






current plan

1) Take in ip and name
2) set ip to a button, when the button is clicked on send the ip and name to the server 
3) server will wait until everyone is ready 
4) use a for loop to set up a the name buttons, when clicked on it, it has a menu :
    1) that allows us to specify the amount of money we want to send to that person
    2) that has their property 
    3) that allows us to trade property with them 
    4) maybe implement get out of jail free cards to trade with


notes: worry about rent and worry about how to format the payment


when it comes to property : store all the rentcahnge in a dictionary

if it's a warter works/ electric or railroad make methodsw in the USER to change the pricing


please try and figure out how the fuck I am going to make the board and piece 
movement(pieces should be of player attribute)
